# December 24th -- Christmas Eve

And here we are, if anyone can believe it, at 2020's Christmas Eve. Or is it still March?

It's been fun checking in on Gemini everyday and writing a short post for the past few weeks but I think going forward I'm probably only going to pass by on a weekly basis. I don't think that's knocking the platform, the calm is a nice respite from the chaotic Web, it just means that things move slowly here.

After about a month, I think I can give a fair review. It's nice. The assortment of personal, meandering prose and whacky experimentation makes browsing the Geminisphere a fun pastime; exploring the age of the Web for which I am too young to have experienced. The collection of interactive elements is nice, from GUS, to the aggregators, to the prototypes of interactive content. As I've discussed previously I think more interactive content would be a good thing, and I continue to intend to contribute to that. I think the real benefits of the platform is the simplistic nature, the limited but sufficient user input, and the widespread adoption of client certificates. This stands in contrast to the Web and is, as intended, a nice respite.

Merry Christmas, and Happy Holidays, all!
