# December 3rd -- First snow

First snow of the winter here today. Snow always brings good memories for me. Days off school. Boring conferences calls spent watching the flurries around St Pauls Cathedral from the office windows. Light drifts hurrying between lectures in Edinburgh.

It's especially nice this year as there's very little to remind me that it is actually Christmas. Sometimes it still feels like the spring. Going to buy some tinsel this weekend. Hang it up around where I now work. Find some (actually good) Christmas music. Try and make the most of what we have.
