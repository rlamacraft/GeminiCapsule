# December 11th -- Harry Potter Audiobooks

For the past few months I've been listening to the Harry Potter audiobooks. It's been a wild ride down memory lane. Surpising how many things I can quote without having read them in something like 13 years. I think I actually have a better appreciation for how good they are as literary works now, but maybe that's just me being now a decade removend from any formal schooling on such things. Sure, they're no Shakespeare or Dickens, but they have to be some of the best books of the past few decades. Definitely worth the time if anyone else has strong childhood memories but hasn't touched them in years.
