# December 17th -- Pistol Shimp and Gobi Fish

Thanks to Daily Dose of Internet[1], I've just discovered the endearing symbiotic relationship between Pistol Shrimps and certains species of Gobi Fish. YouTube led me down a winding path of recommendations from the hilarious clip of two fish fighting over a cave, included in the daily catelog of some of the best stuff from across the Web, to discovering a David Attenborough (who else) video describing the relationship between these two aquatic animals[2]. On the Wikipedia article for Tiger pistol shrimp [3], the relationship is described as follows

> The tiger pistol shrimp lives in burrows in symbiosis with certain goby species ... The shrimp digs and maintains the burrows which are the dens for both animals, while the goby acts as watchman, warning of danger the shrimp cannot see due to poor eyesight.

How thoroughly quaint.
