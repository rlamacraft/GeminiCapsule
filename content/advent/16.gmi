# December 16th -- I can relax now

Christmas presents are all sent. All the busy days at work at are over. I can now finally relax for the rest of the year. Two days left working this week, just four next week, and then I'm off for the rest of the year. Got some cooking planned, some programming projects, but most of all some time to just relax.

Had a week or so off a few months ago, of course couldn't go anywhere, but I've not really had an proper holiday since last Christmas. I know for most people thats untenable but then I'm lucky enough to have been studying and working doing what I really enjoy; but then there's only so far that can take you. Eventually you need some time off. 

It's going to be great.
