# December 9th -- A Long Busy Day

It's been a long, busy day. Started work early knowing it would be.

Popped to the shops straight after the morning stand-up to get the last few Christmas bits for people and get some lunch (an assortment of reduced/nearly expired items that went surprisly well together).

Then I had to deal with the plumber -- there's not even a problem its just the landlord being anxty, though can hardly complainat have an overzealous landlord.

Spent the afternoon starting to wrap up some presents between getting work done.

Worked right though 'till 7, then just made a quick noodle stir-fry that ended up being a bit too spicy.

Plus the heating has been on all day at the behest of the plumber so I've been uncomfortably warm for a few hours.

Such first world problems, I know, I just don't have the energy to say anything halfway interesting. (Sometimes its the everyday life stories on the slow parts of the Internet that I like reading the most, so who cares).
