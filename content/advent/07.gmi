# December 7th -- Scottish weather be crazy

Been listening to fair bit of Passenger on repeat as I work.

> The sun sets late in Glasgow,
> The daylight and the city part.
> And I think of you in Glasgow,
> Cause you're all that's safe.
> You're all that's warm in my resless heart.
  -- Feather on the Clyde // Passenger

Except it's not true. Not in December. Not yet three o'clock and the street was drenched in the orange glow of dusk. No matter how many times he sings it, it doesn't make it true.

And that's not the wackiest thing this week.

## Thundersnow

Thundersnow. We've had lighting storms that resemble Tesla coils. We've had thunderclaps like explosions in the middle of the clear day. We've had endless rain for days. Given I rarely leave the house, its been quite the theatrical piece.

No matter what anyone says, winter is simply the best.
