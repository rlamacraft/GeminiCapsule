# December 12th -- Half way through advent                              

The twelvth day of December; half way to Christmas. Posted some gifts today, and the last parcel arrived. I'm ahead of my usual schedule but then one must take into account inevitable delays in postal delivery, because 2020. Looking forward to no longer sleeping in a room smelling of cardboard and packaging materials.

There were long lines at the supermarket; longest I've seen since spring. I gave up -- didn't need anything urgent anyway. No doubt online deliveries of groceries are all booked up into the new year.

Haven't really bought any food for Christmas, not specifically anyway. Been snacking on plenty of seasonal continental cakes and pastries. Got some mince pies in the freezer. And I'm already on my second jar of cranberry sauce. But nothing for Christmas itself. Will be sure to get some nice cheeses (of course including some Wensleydale with cranberries), some chutneys (including a jar of plum chutney I made in the summer), and some tasty crackers. No doubt I'll be inundated with chocolates. Will be making stuffing and roast potatoes -- my usual. All very exciting!
