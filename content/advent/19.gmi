# December 19th -- What a fantastic day

I have really had a fantastic day!

I started, as almost all Saturdays do, with pancakes[1]. For the first time in a while they all came out perfect; not a single sticking to the pan. Well seasoned cast iron behaving as it should.

Did a bit of cleaning and tidying. Today feels like the first day of Christmas, even though I'm working most of next week, and making everything feel nice and ready is a nice feeling. Put up some tinsle and some lights.

I then did a bit of coding. Been working through a virtual-machine writing tutorial[2] just to make sure I can walk before I try to run[3]. Tomorrow I shall try to write some programs for this VM.

And then I finished the day with some fresh pasta, beef and haggis meatballs, and garlic bread. Awesome dinner.
