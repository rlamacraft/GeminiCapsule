# December 13th -- File types are not either-or

One might naively believe that the type of a file is either one thing or another. Image data is just that, an image. Text is just text. But no, it is possible to carefully craft a file to be of multiple -- even many -- different valid file types. Thanks to specification ambiguities and implementation inconsistencies, a blob of binary data can be interpreted as information in a myriad of different ways.

This LiveOverflow video (yes, YouTube is evil) introduced me to this madness.

And this talk by Ange Albertini shows how far this stuff can be taken
