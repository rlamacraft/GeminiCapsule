# December 10th -- So I've started to mix up some keys

I started to get into mechanical keyboards some months ago. I waited a good long while, but once I secured myself a fully remote job there was nothing stopping me from getting a really loud keyboard. And I really ended up going all out, ordering Zsa's new moonlander, though I made sure to order a test switch set off of Amazon first -- didn't want to be taking any risks with such a large purchase. As a result, I have a variety of different key switches, one of each, that I'm going to place on some keys, just to see if its something I can actually notice day-to-day and whether that will be my next area of exploration. This keyboard just has bog-standard cherry mx browns. I slightly prefered one of the slightly heavier tester keys but the keyboard didn't have that option; so lets give it a go and see if I might want to order a whole set of them.
