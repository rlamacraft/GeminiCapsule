# Summer

In the past two weeks, I've moved from the city to the country to stay with family. After not seeing them for the best part of two years it's nice to catch up. It's also very warm, or as warm as it gets here in the peak of summer.

I'm not a fan of this weather; I get terrible hay fever, and the bugs. The bugs! They're just everywhere. Crawlies that we don't recognise, moths around every light, and little ones flying into all the windows with dull "thuds" at every hour. Never seen so many!

It's also nice to cook for people for once, even if not everyone is a fan of my more adventurous repertoir. Curry, pie, bread rolls, roast tatties, risotto (that one wasn't so good), pancakes, and much else besides.

There's also so much greenery: allotments and gardens galore. Spent the other evening picking and de-hulling peas; just such a different life here. Even in the city I'd like to be able to grow some things. Tomatoes and berries are so much better homegrown; the commercial varieties are optimised for making it to the store in a good condition rather than for flavour.
