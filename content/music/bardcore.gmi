For those not familiar, there's a niche music genre where modern pop songs are covered using medievally inspired instruments and styles. It sounds like a joke, like a meme, but it's honestly great music. Like LoFi, it's such a great example of the kind of the culture that is only possible online. Here's some of my favourites, organised by YouTube channel (unfortunately the most accessible place for amateur music at the moment). Be sure to check out the comments (a first, I know), honestly pretty nice and jovial.

## Hildergard von Blingin'
Without a doubt the best collection, if nothing because of the historical reference in the name.
