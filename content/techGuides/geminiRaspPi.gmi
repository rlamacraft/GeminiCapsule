# Running a Gemini server on a first-gen Raspberry Pi

Here records the trials and tribulations of a lost weekend.

Most of these steps presumably work equally well on any device, minus the build of the server software. 

## Setup instructions

1. Download Adrian Hesketh's server software.
* For the first gen raspberry pi you want the "armv6" build
=> https://adrianhesketh.com Adrian Hesketh
=> https://github.com/a-h/gemini GitHub repo

2. Certificate Generation
* Run the following command to generate a key
``` shell
openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp384r1 -out server.key
```
* Run this, making sure to specify the domain of the server for the hostname when requsted
``` shell
openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 3650
```

3. Create a hello world Gemini file, for testing purposes
``` shell
mkdir content
echo "# Hello, World!" > content/index.gmi
```

4. Run the server, and make sure it all works
* Be sure to change the domain to yours with this one
* Once its running use your gemini client of choice to check it all works
``` shell
gemini serve --domain=example.com --certFile=server.crt --keyFile=server.key --path=content
```

5. Create a script to simplify running
* Just cd to where the server program is and run the command as it appears in step 4, calling the script "run-server.sh"

6. Tell cron to run it at startup
Run
``` shell
crontab -e
```
And append the following
``` shell
@reboot bash run-server.sh
```

And that's it, you're done.
