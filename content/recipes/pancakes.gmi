# Pancakes
This recipe has been pared down as much as possible to make sleepy weekend mornings as easy as possible.

## Ingredients
* A few spoonfuls of flour per person
* Enough soya milk to make the batter barely thicker than the milk itself is

## Method
1. Just whisk the milk into the flour, slowly incorporating the two.
2. Be sure to give additional stir before using, adding extra liquid if it has thickned.
