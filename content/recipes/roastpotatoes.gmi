# Roast Potatoes / Oven Chips

I make this recipe once a week or so. It's my favourite way to cook potatoes and it works well with any dish that is suited to roasted spuds, oven chips (fries), or any kind of crispy wedges. Takes a little work and a little time in the oven, but definitely worth the effort.

## Ingredients
1. Potatoes (duh)
2. For blanching
   1. Ample water
   2. Cheap Salt (like cooking any potatoes, similar to pasta)
   3. Baking Soda (1 tsp or so per portion)
   4. MSG (optional)
3. For roasting
   1. High-smoke point oil -- goose fat works extra well!
   2. Flaky salt

## Method
1. Get the oven heating, and boil some water. If using heavy bakeware, then place in oven with oil now, otherwise wait to add oil later.
2. Cut potatoes into size depending on desired cook time and ratio of crispy outside to fluffy inside. No need to peel.
3. Blanch in water with all of the sodium-based chemicals until beginning to soften; the baking soda really helps with this.
4. Crucial step: when draining the potatoes, really knock them about and fluff them up. Then drizzle oil all over.
5. Spread out on baking tray, giving plenty of space and facing the largest side of each down
6. Once they pull away from the tray easily, flip over. Add additional oil if needed.
7. Once close to being done, toss finishing salt all over, and leave them on low until the rest of the dish is done.
